<p>To get access to the site you need to prove your worth by hacking a webform.
You donâ€™t need any special tools, a browser and a bit of deep digging and youâ€™ll have access in no time.</p>

<h2 id="this-series-2019-edit">This Series [2019 edit]</h2>

<p>The HTB series initially started as a collection of personal write ups for all retired boxes that I found to be useful for training for the OSCP certification.</p>

<p>After I passed I wanted to share my experience and provide my insights to testing on suitable boxes. However post OSCP I had a few commitment changes and had little time to play on the platform.</p>

<p>Fast forward from early 2018 to 2019 and Iâ€™ve got some time back to play. Iâ€™m glad to see the platform has gotten better, both the product and community has grown.</p>

<p>These days it seems everyone and their dog has a write up of these boxes, this is my take on them and while there are some really useful guides Iâ€™m presenting my personal take on the challenges.</p>

<p>If you are looking to beat HTB, IppSec and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA">YouTube Channel</a> contains a walkthrough for all of the retired boxes. In hindsight Iâ€™ve taken different approaches to some of the attacks he used Iâ€™m really just focusing on ones I enjoyed or that I think will help cultivate specific OffSec skills.</p>

<h2 id="useful-scriptlets">Useful Scriptlets</h2>

<p>Some stuff I find handy</p>

<h3 id="setupsh">Setup.sh</h3>

<p>I like to run engagements from a dedicated <code class="highlighter-rouge">OffSec\tmp</code> in my home directory. I always take a backup of my <code class="highlighter-rouge">hosts</code> file as well as some boxes require that we add DNS records to be able to access all areas.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">sudo </span>apt upgrade
<span class="nb">sudo cp</span> /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bkp 
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> ~/OffSec/tmp <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> ~/OffSec/tmp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And for the the clearup afterwards I like to revert the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hosts</code> file and make a password <code class="highlighter-rouge">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</code> protected archive:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp</span> /etc/hosts ~/OffSec/tmp/hosts
<span class="nb">sudo cp</span> /etc/hosts.bkp /etc/hosts
7za a ~/OffSec/SAMPLE.7z <span class="nt">-pXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> ~/OffSec/tmp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the archive back:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>7za x ~/OffSec/SAMPLE.7z <span class="nt">-pXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> <span class="nt">-o</span>/tmp/SAMPLE
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="hosts-file">Hosts File</h3>

<p>If we want to add a domain name to our hosts file:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo cp</span> /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bkp <span class="c">#always make a backup first!</span>
<span class="nb">sudo</span> <span class="nt">--</span> sh <span class="nt">-c</span>  <span class="s2">"echo </span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">10.10.10.xx</span><span class="se">\s</span><span class="s2">ample.htb</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2"> &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And I want to revert it back after the engagement:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo cp</span> /etc/hosts.bkp /etc/hosts
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="connectionsh">Connection.sh</h3>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>openvpn htb.opvn
</code></pre></div></div>
