## What is BooFuzz 

TODO

## The Software

For the time being I'm using Immunity debugger which is a great tool, but it is built on python 2. Until it gets ported to python 3 or I learn some new tools I'm stuck with python 2 on for windows exploit development (at least on x86)

There are quite a few steps to get boofuzz going on a vanilla windows, luckily they are well documented online.

1. BooFuzz from github
2. pydbg from github
3. pydasm in libdasm from github
4. Visual C++ 2008 compiler for python 2
5. WinPCap
6. WinPCap SDK
7. pip install typing

{% highlight powershell %}
Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter\MvmcCmdlet.psd1"
ConvertTo-MvmcVirtualHardDisk -SourceLiteralPath .\BT5R3-GNOME-VM-32.vmdk -DestinationLiteralPath .\BT5R3-GNOME-VM-32 -VhdType DynamicHardDisk -VhdFormat Vhd
{% endhighlight %}

1. __VulnServer:__ For the target app [Vulnserver](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver) offers a lot of bang for your buck, if you can comfortably beat all the ways in here you are ready for CTP.
4. __Immunity Debugger:__ in CTP [OllyDB](http://www.ollydbg.de/) is the Debugger of choice, but if you've done OSCP then [Immunity Debugger](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/) is perhaps more familiar and offers a lot of extensibility with python. Its only downside is that it is not available in py3 (yet?!?)

5. __FUZZER__ Spike - boofuzz https://github.com/jtpereyda/boofuzz.git requires Py3 pip install mode: https://boofuzz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/install.html#prerequisites py2 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/ 
  get boofuzz and do a pip install boofuzz
  get pydbg from here: https://github.com/Fitblip/pydbg 
  get libdasm to install pydasm: https://github.com/jtpereyda/libdasm 
  need C++ compiler for py2
