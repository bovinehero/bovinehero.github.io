In this post I'm going to look at setting up a base Commando image for [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home).

## Prerequisites

You will need a clean install of Commando, my previous post [{{page.previous.title}}]({{page.previous.url}}) covers where to get it and information on how to install it. That's the image I'm starting from. You will also need an account for Hack the Box, I won't be covering how to get an account for it here as that's cheating &#128521; 

If you are really stuck, try looking at the source code.     

## Setting Up the System

Commando ships with a fantastic array of tools by default, but really all we need to do is work out a VPN solution.

Coming Soon!

## Connect to HTB

Coming Soon!


Next post [{{page.next.title}}]({{page.next.url}}) I'm going to look at tackling a retired box on the platform using this VM.
