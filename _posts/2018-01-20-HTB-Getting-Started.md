Getting started with [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)

## Hack Your Way In!

To get access to the site you need to prove your worth by hacking a webform.
You don't need any special tools, a browser and a bit of deep digging and you'll have access in no time.

## This Series

The HTB series initially started as a collection of write ups for all retired boxes that I found to be useful for training for the OSCP certification. It has since evolved into a collection of boxes that I found to be typical of that style.

The work on this site is not intended to be in competition with any of the other write ups on the HTB site, they are my personal take on the challenges.

If you are looking to beat HTB, IppSec and his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA) contains a walkthrough for all of the retired boxes. I'm really just focusing on ones I enjoyed or that I think ar useful for additional practice for those sitting OSCP.
