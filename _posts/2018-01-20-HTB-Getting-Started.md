## This Series [2019 edit]

The HTB series initially started as a collection of personal write ups for all retired boxes that I found to be useful for training for the OSCP certification. 

After I passed I wanted to share my experience and provide my insights to testing on suitable boxes. However post OSCP I had a few commitment changes and had little time to play on the platform.  

Fast forward from early 2018 to 2019 and I've got some time back to play. I'm glad to see the platform has gotten better, both the product and community has grown. 

These days it seems everyone and their dog has a write up of these boxes, this is my take on them and while there are some really useful guides I'm presenting my personal take on the challenges.

If you are looking to beat HTB, IppSec and his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA) contains a walkthrough for all of the retired boxes. In hindsight I've taken different approaches to some of the attacks he used I'm really just focusing on ones I enjoyed or that I think will help cultivate specific OffSec skills.
