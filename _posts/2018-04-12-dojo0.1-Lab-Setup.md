# Read Team Dojos 0: Setting up a local hacking network

In this Dojo we are going to look at setting up a personal network for Offensive Security practice.
There are a number of options we could pursue for this but in the end we are going to install VirtualBox on a native Kali Install.

> If you are running Kali natively, for day to day make sure you do so as a non-root user.

## Prerequisites

You will need an internet connected Kali laptop with at least 4GB of RAM, some spare GBs of Disk Space (about 200GB) nd the ability to handle virtualisation. The links provided assume that you are using the current version of VirtualBox.


## Getting VirtualBox Software

Conveniently now that Kali is packaged off of a Debian Rolling build the days of manual installs of VirtualBox are long behind us. Lets install VirtualBox with the fun addons.

``` bash
# run a repo update and upgrade accepting all installs
sudo apt update %% sudo apt upgrade -y
# install Vbox, the extension pack and the guest additions
sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack virtualbox-guest-additions-iso -y

```
Read and accept the license agreements (use TAB), wait for the install and voila... Virtualbox

## Getting a Target

Make sure that virtual box loads correctly, troubleshoot any issues that pop up.
Google is your friend here, the error codes are pretty verbose but if in doubt after a while you can remove the packages via an apt purge/autoremove and try installing from source.

A favourite resource of mine for Vulnerable Machines is [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/). From here we are going to take the [Bad Store 123](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/badstore-123,41/) image.

This is a great image as it has a lot of baked in issues and, because it was built in 2004 has a 'classic' OS to play about with.

Download the iso as per the link above.

## Setting up the Victim.
The following steps will create a host only connection between the Bad Store and your Kali host.
This setup allows us to create a soft network sandbox for our testing by denying the Bad Store guest internet access. We will still be able to use our Host Kali to browse the web and otherwise interact with the outside networks. 

## 1. Check/Configure a Host Only Adapter Network

By default, when installed, Virtual Box (should) create a Host Only Adapter which can be used to allow a Host system to connect to its guest VMs. This adapter is a virtual NIC, and as a vNIC it can also can be used to host multiple IP Addresses. We'll only need it to host one for now.

1. From the VirtualBox GUI, select __Host Network Adapter__ from the __File__ dropdown.

2. If you don't already have a _VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter_ select __Create__ to make one.

3. Right click on the __Name__ and select __properties__

One I prepared earlier:
> ![v-adapter.png](/assets/images/Lab-Setup/host_only.png)

4. In the __Adapter__ tab, select __Configure Adapter Automatically__ and _enable the server_ in __DHCP Server__. You can configure the network as you see fit, but the defaults are suitable for our purposes.

At this stage we have completed all the Virtual Box configuration that we need to do to complete the Lab.

## 2. Making the Bad Store Virtual Machine

Now we need to build a virtual image to attack. All we need to do here is create an empty VM and attach the Bad Store iso to a virtual CD drive. Once we boot up, it'll give us a valid target to attack.

1. Start by creating a new machine via the __Machine__ dropdown.

2. Give it a suitable name and select _Type: Linux_ and _Version: Ubuntu(32-Bit)_

1. The image only needs 512MB to run, but I'd recommend between 2048MB and 4096MB so we can pound it later.

2. Do __not__ add a hard disk, we will run the image as a live system from the CD drive. Virtualbox will warn you, but we will fix this shortly.

3. This will create a base config in the GUI that we can edit. Next we want to configure the Network Adapter. Select __Network__ from the settings on the right of the GUI. Select the Host-only Adapter option where NAT is specified and accept the defaults.

4. Next power on the BadStore VM and await for the VM to setup.

5. Hit the enter/return key when prompted to drop a shell. Next run the following to capture the ip address of the VM:

``` bash
ifconfig
```

> ![ipaddr.png](/assets/images/Lab-Setup/ipaddr.png)

> In my case the IP address is ```192.168.56.101```

6. perform a quick curl to check the site is up:

```bash
curl -I http://192.168.56.101/
```

this should  pop a 200 OK return similar to the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 10 Jun 2019 20:47:28 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.28 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.8.15 OpenSSL/0.9.7c
Last-Modified: Sun, 14 May 2006 21:16:23 GMT
ETag: "14d-dff-44679e27"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 3583
Content-Type: text/html
X-Pad: avoid browser bug
```

7. At this point you have set up a network for further Dojos, feel free to explore the site on your browser and attack it if you wish.

## Recap

This post we showed you how to quick start a virtual host only network for OffSec training.
You installed, downloaded and configured a vulnerable by design VM and were able to see and interact with it. Next post we will look at some of the basics around enumeration of Bad Store and try to paint a picture of what is going on in the system.
