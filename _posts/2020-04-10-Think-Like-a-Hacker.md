Lots of different terms apply to the offensive side of security, collectively I refer to it as the Red side but what is the difference in the real world?
 
 
## The Different Types of Hacker
 
A lot of people are drawn to the attacking side of security because it carries the mystique of elite and unknown skills.
 
The reality of course is that this side of security is like any other, to be successful all you need is the right attitude and practice.
 
There are 3 main types of hacking I'd like to look at:
 
* Pentesting
* Ethical Hacking
* Red Teaming
 
It is important to realise that all 3 share a similar skill set, but Pentesting != Ethical Hacking != Red Teaming.
 
### Pentester
 
Pentesting is the process of assessing cybersecurity risk for applications. Largley a repeatable and a standardised process, effective pentesting adds considerable value to an application if it is performed early on in the development cycle. 
 
The goal for the pentest is to discover and highlight as many issues as possible. The key metric for success is being able to methodically quantify cyber findings (issues) in order to measure risk.
 
The key security skill for an effective pentester is vulnerability analysis. Being able to articulate how a vulnerability can be exploited and what the impact _could_ be is more preferable for the client than proving your l33t h4xx1ng sk1llz.
 
When it comes down to it, pentesting is like any other testing role outside of security. The goal is to highlight issues for the developers to fix.
 
### Ethical Hacker
 
Ethical Hacking is a comprehensive term which covers general attacks on a system. If pentesting is about finding the vulnerabilities then ethical hacking is about establishing the consequences of them.
 
The goal of an ethical hacker is to show the impact an attack can have on a system and often requires demonstration of the techniques malicious actors would use.
 
The Ethical Hacker needs to have a good understanding of technical paradigms and be able to adapt them to novel circumstances in order to exploit a system. Where a pentester needs a methodical mindset the ethical needs to focus on creativity, thus the goal of the ethical hacker is often exploit systems in a fashion that they were not designed to.
 
### Red Team
 
The Red Team is a term born from US military doctrine and represents a simulated Opposing Force (OpFor) for the defending team (Blue side). The purpose of the Red Team is to act as an intelligent adversary against the system. When working as Red Team scope is typically larger, a building, a network or action on some other objective. 
 
The Red Team gives the organization a chance to practice incident response and fine tune it's defences. Normally the Red Team is just that, a team of specialists each with specific situational skills. A technically focused team attacking a network will often have Networking, Web, Nix and Wintel specialisms within its ranks. 
 
Key for Red Team engagements is adaptability as the Red Team will not always have industry tools readily available. They will often need to 'live off the land' and apply guerrilla tactics in order to action their objectives. 
 
 
## Which is Better?
 
When asked this question most people are drawn to the ethical hacking and red teaming, but in reality they all add value in different ways. As a security professional you should not limit yourself to a single role. Yes as you gain more experience as a pentester you will be better equipped to perform ethical hacking and engage targets as part of a red team but being a successful individual in any of these disciplines requires dedication and practice.
 
If I'm in the business of making software, pentester's offer the best value for money as catching security issues early saves me money in the long term. 
On the other hand if I work in a high stakes complex environment that deals with secret information, employing Red Teams to test defenses offer a measure of insurance against malicious actors.
 
For me Ethical Hackers are the individuals that meet the areas of grey between these two extremes.
