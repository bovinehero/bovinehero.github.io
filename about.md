For the longest time I've been threatening to release a blog site relating to my adventures into InfoSec. Well I finally got a bit of time and pushed a site up. :)

## A disclosure

All content published on this site is intended for educational use, some of it will be opinionated. Regardless of the context of individual post I don't endorse its use for criminal or otherwise nefarious use, nor does any of the content represent the opinions of any of my current or past employers.

## Ads

No ads while I have free hosting! Wooo! Might recommend stuff I like or use.
