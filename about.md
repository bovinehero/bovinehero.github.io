I am the Bovine Hero.
&nbsp;
I started working in IT a while back and have had good fortune to work accross a variety of roles in the sector.
&nbsp;
Originally I started this page as a way to get familiar with web development but after the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 I had a little more time on my hands and decided to make a proper go of it.
&nbsp;
My real passion is in Cybersecurity. Hopefully visiting this site gives you a little more insight into it.

All opinions are my own, they do not represent any company I currently (or historically) work(ed) for.
