I am the Bovine Hero.
&nbsp;
I started working in IT a while back and have had good fortune to work accross a variety of roles in the sector.
&nbsp;
Originally I started this site as a way to get familiar with web development but after the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 I had a little more time on my hands and decided to make a proper go of it.
&nbsp;
My real passion is in Cybersecurity. I don't intend to make all of the posts a detailed walk-through, but if visiting this site gives you a little more insight into a topic... All the better.
&nbsp;
One of the key things in this area is knowing when to ask and knowing how to try harder. Hopefully the contents here will help you try harder.
&nbsp;
All opinions are my own, they do not represent any company I currently (or historically) work(ed) for.

Consume responsibly.
