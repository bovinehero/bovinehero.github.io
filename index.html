          <h1>Secure systems, built on purpose.</h1>
          <p>
            Bovine Hero is the personal space of <strong>Gary Grant</strong> –
            a cyber risk and infrastructure security engineer who enjoys turning
            unreliable, messy systems into predictable, resilient platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site collects labs, notes, and experiments around secure engineering,
            automation, and learning by doing.

      <h2>What I work on</h2>
      <p>
        I care about secure engineering that’s practical: infrastructure that behaves,
        automation that reduces toil instead of adding noise, and learning environments
        that are close enough to reality that they actually prepare people for it.
      </p>

        <div class="project">
          <div class="project-title">Dojos <span>Concept</span></div>
          <p>
            A long-term idea leaning on open-source technologies, SDLC and some DevOps trickery to learn how to manage security tooling.

          <div class="project-title">Security Experiments <span>Research</span></div>
          <p>
            Small, focused exercises exploring risk, architecture, and offence-informed
            defence. Many start as scratch repos or throwaway environments and some make it to tabletop exercises.

          <div class="project-title">Blood Bowl Manager <span>In Progress</span></div>
          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy playing Blood Bowl and I dislike tracking stuff on paper.
            Maybe I'll publish the app some day, but for now it's for me and my buddies.

      <h2>About Bovine Hero</h2>
      <p>
        Bovine Hero is mainly a banner to group together my projects, ideas, and labs.
        The theme is light-hearted, but the work behind it is serious: building and
        running secure systems, and helping others learn how to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years I’ve worked across service desk, infrastructure, cyber risk, and
        security engineering. This site is where the “building secure systems for fun”
        side of that work lives.
